# Binary tree and Binary search tree

definition: A binary tree is a type of data structure in computer science. It is a tree-like structure that has a root node, and each node in the tree has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

The binary search tree has several important properties, such as:

Each node has at most two children
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value

## Big O

**not guaranteed!!May vary bc of the edge case!!**

| Method type | Big O    |
| ----------- | -------- |
| insertion   | O(log n) |
| insertion   | O(log n) |
